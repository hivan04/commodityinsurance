# Do commodities provide portfolio insurance? 🌱
The question we try to answer here is: Do alternative investments provide portfolio insurance during periods of stock market turmoil? <br> 

This research paper provides a brief insight to whether commodities provide portfolio insurance during financial turmoil periods. Within 200 words, the paper covers a comprehensive literature review, brief discussion on descriptive statistics and rolling betas, followed with both a simple regression and Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) regression enforce findings statistically. <br> 

As this was for a University coursework, Stata was used and to replicate, please use the **analysis.do**.

### Key Findings 📝
- - -  
- Found that in general time of crises, a hybrid portfolio did exhibit evidence for portfolio insurace, whilst providing significant and respective returns compared to our pure metal and pure agriculture portfolios. 🛡️ <br>
- The metal and agriculture portoflios performed well during the dot-com crisis, but not during the GFC and COVID. However, we found the reason for this through our literature review, where we predicted for this outcome to be expected due to commodities performing significantly worse and being highly impacted during supply-side shocks. <br>
  - Again, this is no surprise since commodities can be physically-held assets and are affected by many factors which are uncontrollable (specifically agricultural assets), such as: weather. <br>
  - However, commodities can be considered a good alternative asset for financial crises due to the nature of their demand: precious metals will constantly have increasing demand since it is a scarce resource, whilst agricultural assets are typically known to have inelastic demand (such as wheat and soybean). <br>

I hope you all enjoy reading the report (*report coming out soon!*) 😊
